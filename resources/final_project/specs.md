## Introduction

In this project, you will have the opportunity to apply the data science techniques that you have learned throughout the semester to explore and replicate papers from the [Equality of Opportunity Project](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/), led by Harvard Professor Raj Chetty.

The Equality of Opportunity Project aims to provide insights into the sources of economic mobility and to identify effective policy interventions to promote equality of opportunity in the United States. The project has collected an extensive dataset that includes anonymized tax records for millions of individuals, which has been used in numerous research papers to study topics such as intergenerational mobility, the effects of education on earnings, and the impacts of neighborhoods on children's outcomes.

Through this project, you will have the chance to work with this rich dataset and replicate some of the papers published by Professor Chetty and his colleagues. You will use Python and Pandas to explore the data, clean it, and analyze it, applying the techniques you have learned in class to answer research questions and test hypotheses. You will also have the chance explore ideas of your interests using the datasets.

## Deliverables and Rubrics
The template notebook is the template for the final project. Read the project template carefully as it contains all the instructions for this project--each markdown cell provides instructions on what to do in order to complete a successful project. 

Here is the list of deliverables and the grading rubrics. See the project template for more details. 

### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Points |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Abstract | 5%  | 
| Project background | 5% |
| Project objective | 5% |
| Data description | 5% |
| Data cleaning | 5% |
| EDA | 20% |
| Forecasting and Prediction Modeling | 20% |
| Interpretation and Conclusions | 20% |
| Post-Analysis Reproducibility | 10% |
| Clarity, Style and Presentation | 5% |

### Grading Rubrics
For each deliverable, we will award points according to the following percentage scale:

| Grade | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Excellent (above 90%) | Work that is free of all but the most minor errors and demonstrates creativity and/or a very deep understanding of what you are doing. | 
| Good (80-90%) | Work that is free of fundamental errors and demonstrates a basic understanding of what you're doing. |
| Fair (60-80%) | Work with fundamental errors in analysis and/or conveys a lack of understanding of the basics of the work you are attempting to do. |
| Lacking (below 60%) | Work that is severely lacking or incomplete. |

## Datasets and Papers

In order to make the project consistent across teams, we are limiting the project to a specific set of datasets that are linked to economics journal articles.  

Browse and choose one of the datasets from Harvard Professor Raj Chetty's [Equality of Opportunity Project](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/). You will find them neatly presented (and mostly cleaned) together with the title of the corresponding research paper.

## Submission Checklists

* A Jupyter Notebook
* A PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook
* Raw datasets that you downloaded and used
* Immediate datasets (cleaned datasets, merged datasets, etc.)
* Figures and Plots
